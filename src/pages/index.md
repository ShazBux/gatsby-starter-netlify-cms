  title: What is Workday?
  description: >-
    Workday is an app that will help to make life easier for Candidates,
    Nandocas and Managers, and will help us to make Nando’s an even better place
    to work. Nandocas will use it to book holiday, see their pay, see job
    opportunties and more; whilst Managers will use it to recruit, hire,
    on-board, pay and look after the basics for their Nandocas.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
